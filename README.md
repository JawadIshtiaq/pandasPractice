## Introduction

Data wrangling and cleaning are crucial steps in the data analysis process. They involve preparing and transforming raw data into a structured format that can be effectively analyzed. Pandas is a powerful library in Python that provides data structures and functions to make data manipulation tasks more convenient and efficient.

This project documents my exploration of Pandas, where I have practiced its basic functions and techniques to perform various data wrangling and cleaning tasks. The repository includes code examples, datasets, and explanations that can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in learning these skills.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, you need to have the Pandas library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/
```

3. Explore the code examples and datasets provided in the repository to learn about different data wrangling and cleaning techniques using Pandas.

## Examples

The repository contains Jupyter Notebook file, focusing on specific data wrangling and cleaning task. These notebooks include explanations, code snippets, and sample datasets. Some of the examples covered are:

- Loading data into Pandas DataFrames
- Handling missing values
- Filtering and selecting data
- Applying functions to data
- Grouping and aggregation

Feel free to open and run to see the techniques in action.
